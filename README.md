# Netrunner30
## Description
This is a generator for a netrunner event where we had 30 unique decks and wanted to randomly assign the decks in each round as well as alternate Corp/Runner.
The json files for players and decks need to be filled out to begin.

## How to run
`npm install`

`npm run r30 create` will start a new Tourney
`npm run r30 read [x]` will read the name/deck combos for the given round.
